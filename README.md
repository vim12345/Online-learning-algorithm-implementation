# Online-learning-algorithm-implementation
# Description:
An online learning algorithm updates its model incrementally as new data arrives, making it ideal for streaming or real-time systems. In this project, we implement an online logistic regression classifier using SGDClassifier from scikit-learn, which supports learning in mini-batches.

# üîÅ What This Project Demonstrates:
* Implements online/incremental learning with partial_fit

* Simulates streamed training in batches

* Tracks batch-wise model accuracy and final performance
